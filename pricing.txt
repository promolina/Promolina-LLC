        Right now, I’m offering full websites for contractors at a special rate — <strong>$300–$500</strong> — depending on your needs.
        It’s my way of building trust while I grow my business from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This is a limited-time offer for early clients. Once I’m fully booked and established, my rates will go up — because so will the value I deliver.
        So if you’ve been waiting to invest in your business, this is your moment.
